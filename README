Lab 8.0

For this lab I expanded the company intranet system from lab one. I incorporated flask web framework
and created a database to store user data with SQLite. The user can decide to login or create an
account. When a user creates an account, their username must be unique from the other users in the
database or they get a message to create a new one. Their password is hashed using SHA-256 and salted
with a random 40 character length and then stored in the database. The user can choose to have a
strong password generated for them automatically. There are three access levels granted for users.
Each new user is assigned the lowest access level andcan only view the IT Helpdesk and Logout pages.
The users with admin access can visit all the pages and the users with limited access can only view
a few. When a user logs in the password, the password for that user stored in the database is compared
and if it is a match the user is allowed in the system.

To run the program, run the menu.py file.
There are a few test users automatically fill the database upon running to test the access levels.

username1 / password1 / access level admin
username2 / password2 / limited access level
username3 / password3 / lowest access level
